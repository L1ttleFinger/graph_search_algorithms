[WORK IN PROGRESS]

The objective of this project is to implement a visual representation of famous graph search algorithms.

To run the project:
- Create and activate a virtual environment
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- streamlit run app.py

Python implementation of the following graph search algorithms:

- BFS (Breadth First Search)
- DFS (Depth First Search)

TODO:

- A*
- Dijkstra
